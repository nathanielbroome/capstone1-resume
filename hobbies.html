    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Loving on my Dog</h2>
    <img src="./assets/images/puppy-dog.jpg" height="200" />
    <p>This is my dog Eiji, pronounced Ay-gee. Her name means prosperity and peace
        in Japanese. She is a beautiful, sweet, and spoiled Tri-Colored Pitbull. 
    </p>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>I enjoy playing video games when time allows, either solo or with my family.
        My wife likes MK, my oldest boy likes COD, and my youngest likes Madden, so 
        these are the games we play the most.
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li> <h3>Madden</h3>

       <li> <h3>COD</h3>

        </li>

        <li><h3>Mortal Kombat</h3>

        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy reading but go through phases of reading often and then not at all.
        When I do read, these are some of my favorite authors and character series.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Dan Brown</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/angels-demons.png" height="200" />
        </li>

        <li><h3>Patricia Cornwell</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/post-mortem.png" height="200" />
        </li>

        <li><h3>Stuart Woods</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/new-york-dead.png" height="200" />
